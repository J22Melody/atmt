I think it &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ s time for me to lose s@@ om@@ e weight .
a decision will be even more diff@@ ic@@ ult the longer you d@@ el@@ a@@ y it .
I think Tom is smar@@ ter than Mary .
I always con@@ f@@ use wh@@ ic@@ h side is po@@ rt and which star@@ bo@@ ard .

she began to c@@ r@@ y .
ho@@ we@@ ver cold it may be , h@@ e st@@ i@@ ll jo@@ gs 20 k@@ ilom@@ et@@ ers every day .

I wa@@ s wo@@ unded by her co@@ mm@@ ents .
y@@ o@@ u need to mind yo@@ u@@ r own business .
h@@ e was at home .
it &apos;s Tom &apos;s turn to help wash the d@@ i@@ sh@@ es .

Tom saw a girl si@@ tt@@ ing all alone , so he went over to talk to her .
I asked Tom if he w@@ as nerv@@ ous .
w@@ h@@ en do you want to me@@ et Tom ?
I bar@@ ely had time to finish th@@ is re@@ port before the meeting .
I went to Na@@ g@@ as@@ ak@@ i .
T@@ om &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ s had a lot of g@@ ir@@ l@@ friends .
Tom never compla@@ ins .
ple@@ a@@ se leave me alone . I a@@ m busy .
I could spend hours in h@@ ere .
our cat &apos;s f@@ ur has lost i@@ ts lu@@ ster .

my feet are k@@ ill@@ ing m@@ e .
do y@@ o@@ u have a m@@ a@@ p of Boston ?
Tom didn &apos;@@ t know what Mary th@@ ou@@ gh@@ t of it .
I thought you might be cur@@ i@@ ous .
that evening I left my ti@@ p under a co@@ ffe@@ e c@@ up , which I left up@@ side down on the t@@ able .
I &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ d rather die than do what you &apos;re as@@ k@@ ing me t@@ o do .

Tom looked ver@@ y young .
he is Ra@@ mu@@ du .
th@@ e rain hasn &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ t stopped yet , has it ?
you ca@@ n &apos;t do this to yourself .
it was a new exper@@ ie@@ n@@ ce fo@@ r her .
where there &apos;s life , there &apos;s hope .
Tom died three days after he arrived in Boston .
don &@@ ap@@ os@@ ;@@ t you have to go to school today ?

wh@@ at scared you ?
how does she do this ?

Bei@@ j@@ ing is chan@@ ging so r@@ ap@@ i@@ dly .

the rea@@ son I succe@@ e@@ ded was because I was lu@@ c@@ k@@ y .
she has a ke@@ en business sense .
she is listening to him .
ob@@ vi@@ ously I agree that you should adv@@ ance in life through your own e@@ ffor@@ ts .
