Tom is a vide@@ o game de@@ vel@@ op@@ er .
she ca@@ ck@@ led at the poor man . &quot; so it is that you have one wish left . &quot;
are you here on holi@@ day ?
Tom isn &apos;t as tall as his father yet .

I w@@ ish m@@ y dream would come true .
I can &apos;@@ t ig@@ no@@ re that .
he w@@ on the first pri@@ ze at the ch@@ es@@ s tou@@ r@@ na@@ ment .
I could wri@@ te To@@ m a no@@ te if you want me to .
Tom is di@@ et@@ ing .

give her some flo@@ wer@@ s in re@@ t@@ ur@@ n f@@ or her kin@@ d@@ ness .
I &apos;ll get my ke@@ ys .
he has more books th@@ a@@ n I do .
this figure is supp@@ os@@ ed to re@@ pre@@ sent Mar@@ i@@ l@@ y@@ n Mon@@ ro@@ e , but I don &apos;t think it does her ju@@ sti@@ ce .
it &apos;s very important to respect t@@ he ru@@ les .
ra@@ ise your ha@@ n@@ d if you wa@@ nt t@@ o spea@@ k .
he &apos;s getting up early .
we &apos;@@ v@@ e made a fin@@ al decision .
I ju@@ st started reading this bo@@ o@@ k .
she looked me in the eye .
please do@@ n &apos;t ask .
do you know wh@@ ose car this is ?
I have never been so hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ated in my enti@@ re life .
my father has lived in Na@@ go@@ y@@ a fo@@ r more than fif@@ te@@ en years .
I d@@ on &apos;t really agree with that .
Mary &apos;s f@@ a@@ ther was a sa@@ il@@ or who never came back .
it takes two y@@ ears for the bu@@ tter@@ fly to ma@@ ture .
